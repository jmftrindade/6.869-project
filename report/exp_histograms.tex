\subsection{Per class histograms}

\todo{Mention MNIST stuff at all? In those we did get some useful information by looking at activation histograms, but that dataset is a lot less complex.}

\begin{itemize}
\item How histogram is derived from layer activations summary
\item Per class correctly classified vs misclassified
\item Mention how it was difficult to extract any meaningful correlations, given that there were little instances of misclassified examples that fall into the same wrong class for a given correct class
\item Mention challenges in terms of dataset diversity, which the clustering approach seems to be robust enough to handle, but a pixel-wise distribution of activations cannot handle (it does fine with simpler datasets such as MNIST)
\end{itemize}
