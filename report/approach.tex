\section{Approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item Recap of high level motivation, maybe tie it back to how we differ from related work, e.g., they look at individual units, while we think summaries are enough to recover granularity of concepts recognized in each layer
\item Two main approaches: intra-layer single-image summaries, and intra-layer summary feature vectors \todo{better naming}
\end{itemize}
