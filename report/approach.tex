\section{Approach}

We propose two new methods to augment current CNN interpretability tools. While other approaches focus on individual neurons, our techniques focus on summarizing entire layers of the network. Our methods are layer summarization, described in Section \ref{ss:layer_summaries} and unit summarization in Section \ref{ss:approach_feature_vectors}.
