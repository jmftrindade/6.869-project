\subsection{Qualitative Evaluation: Activation Summaries}

\todo{ move to eval 'Comparing the layer-by-layer summaries of an original and a perturbed image reveals changes in the overall activations in a layer that may lead to change in activations. The process of generating summaries and comparing them for an original image and a perturbed image is demonstrated in figure ~\ref{fig:act_im_summary_fig} where the aggregation function is a simple average over the pixels of the activation images of a correctly classified living room image and the same image with the fireplace removed by image manipulation software.' }
